### Introduction
This project combines two things I love, trivia and music. I aimed to make the sort of game I would like to play. It only uses songs from Billboard's yearly Top 100 lists (with one possible exception), which I grouped by genre to increase the difficulty.  This is one of my first projects upon learning HTML5/CSS/JS. So far it's not so much an app as it is a series of web pages, but one day it will be. I designed the backgrounds in the individual decades in Procreate. The photo of the blue record is from Unsplash.


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6
* Procreate/Photoshop


### Project Status
I am still updating this project, as I learn more and get better. I have plans to double the amount of questions, add in an easy mode, adding basic sounds, and one day make it an actual game/app.


### Sources
I started this pretty early in my JS education (before I learned the latest syntax) so I read a few tutorials on quiz apps. I learned the most with Web Dev Simplified (on Youtube), which is largely what this quiz is based on. Also as mentioned above, the one photo (used on many pages) is from Unsplash. It is credited on the website!
