### Introduction
Project can be viewed on traversingtheverses.com!

This project combines two things I love, trivia and music. I aimed to make the sort of game I would like to play. It 
only uses songs from Billboard's yearly Top 100 lists (with one possible exception), which I grouped by genre per 
question to increase the difficulty.  This is one of my first projects upon learning HTML5/CSS/JS. So far it's not so 
much an app as it is a series of web pages, but one day it will be. I designed the backgrounds in the individual 
decades in Procreate. The cassette splash screen and the the cassette brand images are made in Affinity Designer 
(a vector graphics program).


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6
* Procreate/Photoshop
* Affinity Designer


### Project Status
I am still updating this project, as I learn more and get better. I have plans to double the amount of questions, add 
in an easy mode, adding basic sounds, and one day make it an actual game/app.


### Sources
I started this pretty early in my JS education (before I learned the latest syntax) so I read a few tutorials on quiz 
apps. I learned the most with Web Dev Simplified (on Youtube), which is largely what this quiz is based on. I've 
recently rewritten it to get rid of the reliance on outside libraries.
